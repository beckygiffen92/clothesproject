# clothesproject

eStyler is an outfit generator targeted at young women. This application allows users to select their outfit style and their occasion, it then takes that information to cloud firestore and then picks 2 suitable outfits at random that have been carefully curated based on target research. 
eStyler promotes rewearing and recycling clothes. Although we encourage users to wear what they already own, we recognise that fashion and shopping will always be around so for those who do like shopping; we encourage those to do sustainably by providing discount codes for sustainable fashion brands.
